# Cookiecutter For Plone?

An experiment to try out [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) for Plone usage.

If you want to try it out, do the following:

    $ mkvirtualenv cookies
    (cookies)$ pip install cookiecutter
    (cookies)$ cookiecutter https://github.com/claytron/cookiecutter-plonebasic

This will generate the package, which right now won't actually work if loaded into Plone.
